Recall from lecture that this algorithm is not always optimal.  IMPORTANT: if two jobs have equal difference (weight - length), you should schedule the job with higher weight first.  Beware: if you break ties in a different way, you are likely to get the wrong answer.  You should report the sum of weighted completion times of the resulting schedule --- a positive integer --- in the box below. \n",

OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an additional challenge, try implementing a heap-based version. The simpler approach, which should already give you a healthy speed-up, is to maintain relevant edges in a heap (with keys = edge costs).  The superior approach stores the unprocessed vertices in the heap, as described in lecture.  Note this requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably need to maintain some kind of mapping between vertices and their positions in the heap."
