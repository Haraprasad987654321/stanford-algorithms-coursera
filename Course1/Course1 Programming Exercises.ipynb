    "Compute the number of comparisons (as in Problem 1), using the \"median-of-three\" pivot rule.  [The primary motivation behind this rule is to do a little bit of extra work to get much better performance on input arrays that are nearly sorted or reverse sorted.]  In more detail, you should choose the pivot as follows.  Consider the first, middle, and final elements of the given array.  (If the array has odd length it should be clear what the \"middle\" element is; for an array with even length 2k2k, use the k^{th}k \n",
    "th\n",
    "  element as the \"middle\" element. So for the array 4 5 6 7,  the \"middle\" element is the second one ---- 5 and not 6!)  Identify which of these three elements is the median (i.e., the one whose value is in between the other two), and use this as your pivot.  As discussed in the first and second parts of this programming assignment, be sure to implement Partition exactly as described in the video lectures (including exchanging the pivot element with the first element just before the main Partition subroutine).\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE: For the input array 8 2 4 5 7 1 you would consider the first (8), middle (4), and last (1) elements; since 4 is the median of the set {1,4,8}, you would use 4 as your pivot element.\n",
    "\n",
    "SUBTLE POINT: A careful analysis would keep track of the comparisons made in identifying the median of the three candidate elements.  You should NOT do this.  That is, as in the previous two problems, you should simply add m-1m−1 to your running total of comparisons every time you recurse on a subarray with length mm."

    "Your task is to code up and run the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem and use it on the above graph to compute the min cut.  (HINT: Note that you'll have to figure out an implementation of edge contractions.  Initially, you might want to do this naively, creating a new graph from the old every time there's an edge contraction.  But you should also think about more efficient implementations.)   (WARNING: As per the video lectures, please make sure to run the algorithm many times with different random seeds, and remember the smallest cut that you ever find.)  Write your numeric answer in the space provided.  So e.g., if your answer is 5, just type 5 in the space provided."
